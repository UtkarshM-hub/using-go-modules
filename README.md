# Using go modules

Go switched to using modules by default starting with Go 1.16. This essentially means
that all Go packages must be a module.

This repository contains exammples of achieving common tasks when using modules:

- [Simple hello world with sub-packages, but no external dependency](./hello-world)
- TODO: Use an external package
- TODO: Using a changed/local version of an external package
